# ImgGuessr
I am planning to make a multi player game where the players take turns thinking of a topic that the other players have to guess. The player who comes up with the topic adds general pictures describing the subject. For example, when you come up with the topic of fishing, you could show pictures of water, a boat, and an aquarium. 

**About this project**

This project is part of the Real-Time Applications course at CMD, part of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. In this course we will learn how to build a real-time application, with open connections between the client and the server.
